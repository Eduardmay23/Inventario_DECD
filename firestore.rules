/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @version 2
 *
 * @description
 * This ruleset enforces public read access and authenticated-user-only write access to the 'products' and 'loans' collections.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /products/{productId}: Stores product inventory information.
 * - /loans/{loanId}: Stores product loan records.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Unauthenticated listing/reading of products and loans is permitted.
 * - Only authenticated users can create, update, or delete products and loans.
 * - No role-based access control is implemented.
