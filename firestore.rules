/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for StockWise.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a hybrid security model. Core data (Products, Locations, Loans)
 * is publicly readable but writable only by authenticated users. User-specific
 * data (StockAlerts) is strictly owned by each user. Admins have elevated
 * privileges to manage other users.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /products/{productId}: Public product information.
 * - /locations/{locationId}: Public location information.
 * - /loans/{loanId}: Loan records.
 * - /products/{productId}/stockLevels/{stockLevelId}: Stock levels for products.
 * - /users/{userId}: User profile information.
 * - /users/{userId}/stockAlerts/{stockAlertId}: User-specific stock alerts.
 * - /products/{productId}/stockMovements/{stockMovementId}: Stock movement history for a product.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Admins are allowed to update user profiles, while regular users can only update their own.
 * - StockAlerts are strictly user-owned and stored under the /users/{userId} path.
