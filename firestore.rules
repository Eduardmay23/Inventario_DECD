/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for StockWise.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a straightforward security model suitable for an internal
 * admin-like application. All authenticated users are treated as trusted operators.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /products/{productId}: Product information.
 * - /locations/{locationId}: Location information.
 * - /loans/{loanId}: Loan records.
 * - /movements/{movementId}: Records of stock adjustments.
 * - /users/{userId}: User profile information.
 *
