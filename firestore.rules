/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for StockWise.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset provides public read access to all collections and allows all authenticated users to create, update, and delete documents.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The database consists of several top-level collections: 'categories', 'products', 'stock_levels', 'locations', 'stock_alerts', and 'stock_movements'.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read access for all collections.
 * - Unrestricted write access for all authenticated users.
